After presenting our goals to Red Hat they have chosen to sponsor the development of YACS! This is great news and we are very thankful to Red Hat for their support. It also gives us the the added benefit of being mentored by Stephen Gallager from Red Hat who is also a RPI Alum and we would like to thank him for taking out time to mentor the team.

We look forward to doing some great work this semester. Check back soon for more updates!
