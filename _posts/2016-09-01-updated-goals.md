Hello All,

We're back in RCOS with some new goals for this semester. Our formal proposal is [here](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/YACS-Fall-2016-Proposal-YV0KIZBc00TVSwrBwiIZy) (have you tried Dropbox Paper yet?? I'ts pretty great) but it boils down to a few overarching goals: ensure reliability and performance, add user requested features, and, most importantly, make YACS ready to deploy at another school.

Getting YACS ready for another school will require a few things, namely, defining a deploy process, creating a better and more generalized catalog interface, and improve our documentation overall (full details can be found in the proposal. This is our most important goal, as having contributors outside of RPI will help ensure the long-term continuity of YACS.

We've also had many requests for better information about conflicts in schedules and sharing features, so we will be addressing those this semester.

Additionally, there a few issues where certain requests (very large or large in number schedules) can cause the application to spend tens of seconds on a single request with no limit, which could bring the app down at a larger school. In order to solve this well we will have to change the way generate schedules.

If we have time at the end of the semester, I'd personally like to analyze the changes in seats over time and the schedules people make to see if we can collect any interesting data.

Look out for future posts covering these issues in detail!
