So far, YACS Admin refactor has been coming along pretty smoothly. This is my first semester with RCOS and YACS, and it has been somewhat of a challenge learning Rails, Angular, and Jasmine. Overall though, it has been a great learning experience. I feel pretty comfortable working with Angular and I relearned a lot of JavaScript. 

Almost all the components have been implemented in the Angular app and I’ve recently been working on writing unit tests. I don’t have much experience with testing so it’s been a little slow at first, but it’s an important part of development and will definitely be useful to know for any future projects. Also, I have personally found Angular to be a lot easier to learn and work with than the previous Rails build. The refactor should be completed soon, and we can start working on more exciting features.
