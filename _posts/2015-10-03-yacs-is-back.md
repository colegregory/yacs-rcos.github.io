After a long hiatus, development on YACS is back on track with a new team and
new goals! For the uninitiated, YACS is Yet Another Course Scheduler that
provides a simple and sane web-based approach for the RPI student community to
schedule their classes. It was initially started off by Jeff Hui – an RPI alum
and former RCOS member. Over the years, it has served the community well and on
behalf of the entire RPI student community we would like to extend our thanks to
Jeff for taking the initiative of making YACS. Unfortunately after Jeff’s
graduation, the project has fallen into a bit of disarray as there was no one to
support and maintain it. After all, there is only so much one person can do.

Fast forward to the Fall of 2015 and YACS finally has a new team that is looking
forward to getting the application back on track with a few improvements to its
features. First, we are refactoring the current code base (written in
Python/Django) to Ruby on Rails. Due to the presence of some undocumented bugs
coupled with the fact that the original developers are no longer actively
involved with its development, we decided a rewrite of the backend was in order.
The new Rails backend is underway on the new Github page. We’ve also started
work on an iOS application, which another on campus organization has expressed
interest in as well.

Secondly, one of the biggest issues with YACS is the lack of accurate seat
availability information. If you’ve used YACS recently, then you are probably
aware that this information is often out of date. To address this, we are
working with the Registrar to gain access to live or more frequently updated
seat availability data. We will provide updates on this matter as they become
available. Our goal is to, by the end of the semester, provide students with
seat data that is recent enough to plan schedules during the busiest
registration time slots. We also plan to add new course sorting and filtering
abilities to make navigating and picking courses a little easier. Ultimately, we
would like to integrate our work with that of the Plan of Study team to provide
a more extensive and dynamic course planning platform.

We are very excited to get YACS back up to speed and improve the experience as a
whole and hope that it replaces the ROCS as the default scheduling option on the
SIS.
